Supra MultiVM is a core feature of the Supra Layer-1 blockchain that allows developers to deploy smart contracts written in different programming languages and from various blockchain ecosystems natively on the Supra network.

The MultiVM (Multiple Virtual Machine) support means developers do not need to learn a new language or port their existing code to build on Supra. Instead, they can use the Virtual Machine and programming language they are already familiar with.

Supra's MultiVM architecture currently supports or plans to support:

- **MoveVM:** For smart contracts written in the Move language (used by Aptos and Sui)
- **EVM:** For Solidity smart contracts from the Ethereum ecosystem
- **SolanaVM (SVM):** Coming soon, for smart contracts written in Rust (used by Solana)
