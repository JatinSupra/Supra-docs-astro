Supra MultiVM is a core feature of the Supra Layer-1 blockchain that allows developers to deploy smart contracts written in different programming languages and from various blockchain ecosystems natively on the Supra network.

The MultiVM (Multiple Virtual Machine) support means developers do not need to learn a new language or port their existing code to build on Supra. Instead, they can use the Virtual Machine and programming language they are already familiar with.

Supra's MultiVM architecture currently supports or plans to support:

- **MoveVM:** For smart contracts written in the Move language (used by Aptos and Sui)
- **EVM:** For Solidity smart contracts from the Ethereum ecosystem
- **SolanaVM (SVM):** Coming soon, for smart contracts written in Rust (used by Solana)

## Benefits of Supra MultiVM

### Flexibility for Developers
Developers can build with their preferred language and environment, streamlining the development process. This removes barriers to entry and allows teams to leverage their existing expertise and codebases.

### Interoperability and Shared Liquidity
MultiVM fosters a unified ecosystem where assets and information can be exchanged across different VMs on the same L1, avoiding the liquidity fragmentation issues common in appchain-based systems. Smart contracts deployed on any supported VM can interact with each other seamlessly.

### Parallel Execution
The MultiVM architecture is integrated with Supra's "Tribe and Clan" node model, which allows different Clans to manage different state shards and use independent VMs. This enables parallel transaction processing across different virtual machines, significantly boosting the network's overall throughput and efficiency.

### Access to Native Services
Smart contracts deployed on any supported VM can seamlessly access Supra's vertically integrated native services, including:
- High-speed native Oracle price feeds (covering crypto, equities, commodities, FX)
- On-chain verifiable randomness (dVRF) for tamper-resistant randomness
- Native automation capabilities for deterministic, block-by-block task execution
- Cross-chain messaging through Hypernova and IntraLayer for trustless interoperability

These capabilities are built directly into the protocol layer, eliminating the need for complex and expensive third-party integrations.

## High-Performance Infrastructure

### Sub-Second Finality
Supra's Layer 1 blockchain employs the Moonshot consensus algorithm to achieve sub-second consensus finality across distributed validators. This high-performance design ensures that on-chain decisions are finalized rapidly, enabling automation primitives and time-sensitive operations to execute without discretionary delays.

### Real-Time Data Integration
Native Oracle feeds are integrated directly into the protocol layer, providing continuous, tamper-resistant streams of asset prices, volatility metrics, and external data. This reduces reliance on third-party Oracle networks and minimizes manipulation risks while enabling smart contracts to respond instantly to market conditions.

### MEV Protection
Supra includes verifiable randomness at the protocol level to provide transparent, tamper-resistant randomness for validator selection and randomized ordering of transaction execution, helping to mitigate vulnerabilities related to Maximum Extractable Value (MEV) extraction.

## Developer Experience
The MultiVM approach means:

- **Zero friction:** Deploy existing contracts with minimal changes
- **Native tooling:** Use familiar development tools and frameworks from each ecosystem
- **Unified infrastructure:** Access the same high-performance Layer 1, Oracle feeds, and automation regardless of which VM you choose
- **Cross-VM interactions:** Smart contracts on different VMs can call each other and share state through Supra's unified architecture
