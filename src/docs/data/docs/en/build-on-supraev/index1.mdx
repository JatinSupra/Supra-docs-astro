## Initialize and Set Up Your Project Directory

Create and navigate to your **Foundry** project directory, similar to Hardhat, to prepare for smart contract development.

```bash
forge init foundry-project
cd foundry-project
```

### Configure foundry.toml

Set up the **Foundry** configuration by specifying the **SupraEVM RPC URL**, chain ID, and your private key to enable seamless deployment and interaction with smart contracts.

```bash
[profile.supra]
rpc_url = "https://rpc-evmstaging.supra.com/rpc/v1/eth"
chain_id = 119
private_key = "0xYourPrivateKey"
```

## Create a Smart Contract File

Set up the `SimpleStorage.sol` file in the `src` directory to define a basic **Solidity smart contract** that allows storing and retrieving a `uint256` value on **SupraEVM**.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SimpleStorage {
    uint256 public storedData;

    function set(uint256 x) public {
        storedData = x;
    }

    function get() public view returns (uint256) {
        return storedData;
    }
}
```

## Create a Deployment Script

Write a deployment script in the `script` directory (`DeploySimpleStorage.sol`) to automate smart contract deployment on **SupraEVM** using **Foundry’s scripting tools**.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "forge-std/Script.sol";
import "../src/SimpleStorage.sol";

contract DeploySimpleStorage is Script {
    function run() external {
        uint256 privateKey = vm.envUint("PRIVATE_KEY");
        vm.startBroadcast(privateKey);
        new SimpleStorage();
        vm.stopBroadcast();
    }
}

```

## Compile the Contract

Run `forge build` to compile your **Solidity smart contract**, ensuring that the code is free of errors and ready for deployment on **SupraEVM**.

```bash
forge build
```

## Deploy the Contract using force create:

Use `forge create` to deploy your contract on **SupraEVM**, specifying the contract path, RPC URL, and private key. This command will broadcast the transaction to the network, making the contract live.

```bash
forge create src/SimpleStorage.sol:SimpleStorage --rpc-url https://rpc-evmstaging.supra.com/rpc/v1/eth --private-key 0xPrivateKey --broadcast 
```

### Using Cast Send for Transactions

Interact with your deployed contract using `cast send`, which allows you to execute functions on-chain.

You can interact with the deployed contract using `cast send`.

For example, to call the `set` function:

```bash
cast send <DeployedContractAddress> "set(uint256)" 42 --rpc-url https://rpc-evmstaging.supra.com/rpc/v1/eth --private-key 0xYourPrivateKey
```

### View Contract State using Cast Call

Retrieve stored data from your contract using `cast call`, which reads contract state without sending a transaction, making it gas-free.

To view the state of the contract, use `cast call`:

```bash
cast call <DeployedContractAddress> "get() view returns (uint256)" --rpc-url https://rpc-evmstaging.supra.com/rpc/v1/eth
```

By using `forge create` and `cast send`, you can deploy and interact with your smart contract on the Supra EVM network.
